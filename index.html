To many's surprise my name is Jakub Medyński. Born in Gdańsk, Poland, raised in
Stockholm, Sweden. It's hard to summarize one's life in couple sentences, yet 
here's my try on my origin:

   Since a kid I've been filled with love to nature and sound thanks to my 
   amazing parents who love travels, trekking,  organized events, singing,  
   music, and all that with our big family of friends.  My programming has 
   been diversified with countless actions like karate, swimming, computer  
   club,  chess, cooking,  biking, football,  climbing, painting, and much 
   more. Yet nothing stuck to as much as dancing, music, scouting and LEGO.
   I give all the gratitude to the  <b>EPIC</b>  teachers who shaped my path with 
   patience and belief, and who, despite my stubbornness and disobedience,
   gave me chance after chance to gather more  and more experience. Thanks
   to all other people,  who constantly probed my own understanding of the 
   world.  Who pushed me towards formulation of questions, which I've ever 
   since than been seeking answers too.  After almost 28 cycles around the 
   earth,  I've tried myself within another endless amount of disciplines, 
   which of computer science,  group dynamics, trance, and ecocentrism has 
   caught my attention for the moment. Setting my class description in the
   game of life to: 

   <i>Bard Hacker Scout</i>, or leaving more to imagination – <i>a wizard</i>.

   Main skills of greater magnitude: 
     • Teleportation (appearing in the perfect time in the right place)
     • Invisibility  (fluorescent colored jacket and other shiny objects)
     • Manifestation (asking for whatever is needed and making something 
                      out of nothing)
     • Focus         (being able to navigate the attention of the 
                      surrounding)

id="WHATIDO"/><h1><a href="#HOME">#WHAT<b>I</b>DO?</a></h1><whatido>    Dancing thought the world sharing unconditional love and joy wherever I 
    appear.   In belief that  everything  can live in  harmony with help of 
    setting example by oneself. We are provided with abundance by earth, in
    all fields. All that has to be done is sharing it. So thence my current 
    mission  –  maintaining safe space for the surrounding to grow to their
    own conclusions. Sometimes pushing people that I love to reach our full
    potential faster,  but only a messure to improve  my  own communication 
    skills.

    As a side project working  on  gathering  and  developing  methods  for 
    overwriting fear and traumatic programs  –  building courage and  self-
    love.

    Since mid June of 2023 I've started to play electronic music on various
    events, so far on 11 of them with 23 sets played, ragning from 30min to
    10h.  As of now I took the jump into the sea of Sound Engineering,  and 
    hopefully will be able to performe live acts in Europe during summer.

    <y>Q</y>: How to help?
    <g>A:</g> Share whatever you got, with whomever needs it!

    <y>Q</y>: But I don't have anything to share, what can I do?
    <g>A:</g> You always can gift love! As much as a simple smile or a kind word can 
       be enough to break a loop and free one's mind. Another suggestion is to 
       ask other being for help. That creates opportunities for them to share.
       <i>Sharing for isn't only about giving, it's as well receiving, keepin the 
       energy in balance.</i>

    <y>Q</y>: How do I know who needs what?
    <g>A:</g> Observer and ask. Sometimes you can feel(see, hear, smell, etc) what
       other beings need, and if you're not sure you can always ask!

    <y>Q</y>: Other being don't accept my help, why?
    <g>A:</g> Often we try to help in our own way, not really trying to understand 
       the need of other being. Simple misunderstanding can lead to conflicts.
       Listen carefully and try to figure out together what you want.

    <y>Q</y>: How can I help you personally?
    <g>A:</g> Everything runs on some nutrition, my is simply joy. I'm rich in the
       currency of time yet sometimes I've to spend it on gathering resources. 
       If you know that you have enough for yourself and would like to share
       some of your resources just reach me, or choose yourself:

       you would spend on sweets or other non-vital purchases.</i>
